# Hack Simulator üñ•Ô∏è

A fun, educational terminal-based "hack" simulator that creates movie-style hacking effects in your console. Perfect for pranks, demonstrations, or just having fun with friends!

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Disclaimer

**This package is purely for educational and entertainment purposes.** It contains no malicious code and performs no actual hacking activities. It simply displays fake terminal output to simulate the appearance of hacking as portrayed in movies and TV shows.

## Features

- üé¨ Movie-style hacking simulation
- üåà Colorful terminal output with animations
- üîÄ Randomized content for different experiences each run
- ‚ö° ASCII art banner and visual effects
- üéØ Simulated network scanning, exploitation, and infiltration phases
- üõ°Ô∏è Completely safe - no actual system interaction

## Installation

### Global Installation (Recommended)
```bash
npm install -g hack-simulator
```

### Local Installation
```bash
npm install hack-simulator

## What It Does

The simulator runs through several phases:

1. **ASCII Banner Display** - Shows the "HACK-SIM" logo
2. **Matrix Effect** - Displays scrolling binary numbers
3. **System Breach Sequence** - Simulates detection and initialization
4. **Network Reconnaissance** - Fake network scanning with IP addresses and ports
5. **Exploitation Phase** - Displays fake hacking commands and responses
6. **Infiltration Status** - Shows progress messages with completion indicators
7. **Final Message** - Confirms the "hack" is complete

## Customization

The simulator includes several arrays that can be easily modified:

- `fakeCommands`: Common penetration testing tools and commands
- `fakeIPs`: IP addresses used in network scanning simulation
- `fakeErrors`: Error messages that occasionally appear
- `statusMessages`: Progress indicators for the infiltration phase

## Dependencies

- `chalk`: For colorful terminal output
- `figlet`: For ASCII art text generation

## Educational Value

This tool can be used to:

- Demonstrate what "hacking" looks like in movies vs. reality
- Introduce students to common cybersecurity terminology
- Create engaging presentations about cybersecurity
- Provide a fun way to discuss ethical hacking concepts

## Safety Notes

- No network connections are made
- No files are accessed or modified
- No system commands are executed
- All output is purely cosmetic
